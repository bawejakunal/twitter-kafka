#Kafka Demo using Twitter Streaming API

This is a simple demo for streaming tweets in real time from twitter and storing into a single node
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) cluster. We also demonstrate the use of [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) consumer module to 
to subscribe to the **twitter channel** and consume the tweets uploaded to that channel by the [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) Producer.
